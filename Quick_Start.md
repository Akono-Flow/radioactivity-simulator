# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Radioactivity Simulator

## Get Started in 3 Minutes!

### Step 1: Open the Simulator
1. Make sure both files are in the same folder:
   - `radioactivity-simulator.html`
   - `radioactivity-simulator.js`
2. Double-click `radioactivity-simulator.html`
3. Your browser will open the simulator

### Step 2: Your First Nuclide
Let's plot Carbon-14, a famous radioactive isotope!

1. Look at the **Control Panel** on the right
2. Find the **"Plot Nuclide"** section
3. Enter these values:
   - **Atomic Number (Z)**: `6` (Carbon has 6 protons)
   - **Mass Number (A)**: `14` (Total protons + neutrons)
4. Click **"Plot on Graph"**

**What You'll See:**
- An orange/yellow point appears on the graph
- Nuclide information displays: ¹⁴C
- N:P Ratio: 1.333 (8 neutrons ÷ 6 protons)
- Status: **Unstable** (shown in red)
- Region: "Above band (Neutron-rich)"

### Step 3: Make Your First Prediction

Now the fun part - predict what will happen!

1. Look at the **"Predict Decay Mode"** section
2. Think about it:
   - Carbon-14 has too many neutrons
   - It's above the band of stability
   - What decay mode converts neutrons to protons?
3. Click **"β⁻ Decay"** (Beta-Minus Decay)
4. Click **"Check Answer"**

**Result:**
- ✅ Correct! Green highlight appears
- You'll see: "This nuclide has excess neutrons. A neutron converts to a proton..."
- Your statistics update: 1 attempt, 1 correct, 100% accuracy!

### Step 4: Try a Random Nuclide

1. Click the **"Random Nuclide"** button in the canvas controls
2. A new unstable nuclide appears
3. Make another prediction
4. Check your answer
5. Watch your statistics grow!

## 🎯 Quick Reference: Prediction Cheat Sheet

### When to Choose Each Decay Mode:

**Alpha (α) Decay:**
- ✅ Atomic number (Z) > 83
- Example: Uranium, Plutonium, Radium

**Beta-Minus (β⁻) Decay:**
- ✅ Nuclide is ABOVE the band (too many neutrons)
- ✅ N:P ratio is HIGH
- Example: Carbon-14, Tritium

**Beta-Plus (β⁺) Decay:**
- ✅ Nuclide is BELOW the band (too many protons)
- ✅ Light elements (Z < 30)
- ✅ N:P ratio is LOW
- Example: Fluorine-18, Carbon-11

**Electron Capture:**
- ✅ Nuclide is BELOW the band (too many protons)
- ✅ Heavier elements (Z > 30)
- ✅ N:P ratio is LOW
- Example: Potassium-40 (can also do β⁺)

## 📊 Understanding the Graph

### What the Colors Mean:

**Blue/Cyan Area** = Band of Stability
- This is where stable nuclides live
- Like a "safe zone" for nuclei

**Red Dashed Line** = N:P = 1:1
- For light elements (Z ≤ 20)
- Equal protons and neutrons

**Green Dashed Line** = N:P = 1.5:1
- For heavier elements (20 < Z ≤ 83)
- More neutrons needed

**Small Cyan Dots** = Known Stable Isotopes
- Real stable nuclides from nature
- Reference points for stability

**Large Orange Point** = Your Plotted Nuclide
- The one you're studying
- Shows where it sits on the graph

## 🎓 Practice Exercises for Beginners

### Exercise 1: Light Elements
Try these and predict the decay mode:

1. **Tritium** (Hydrogen-3): Z=1, A=3
   - Answer: β⁻ (excess neutrons)

2. **Helium-5**: Z=2, A=5
   - Answer: β⁻ (very neutron-rich)

3. **Lithium-5**: Z=3, A=5
   - Answer: β⁺ (proton-rich)

### Exercise 2: Medium Elements
1. **Iron-55**: Z=26, A=55
   - Think: Is it above or below the band?

2. **Cobalt-60**: Z=27, A=60
   - Hint: Count the neutrons

3. **Copper-64**: Z=29, A=64
   - Could go either way!

### Exercise 3: Heavy Elements
1. **Radium-226**: Z=88, A=226
   - Answer: α (Z > 83, always!)

2. **Uranium-238**: Z=92, A=238
   - Answer: α (heavy element)

3. **Plutonium-239**: Z=94, A=239
   - Answer: α (very heavy)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use Click-to-Plot
Instead of typing Z and A, you can click anywhere on the graph!
- Just click where you want to place a nuclide
- The simulator calculates Z and N automatically
- Super fast for exploring!

### Tip 2: Show Decay Path
After plotting an unstable nuclide:
1. Click **"Show Decay Path"**
2. See the complete decay chain
3. Watch it move toward stability
4. Learn the sequence of decays

### Tip 3: Track Your Progress
- Check **"Practice Statistics"** regularly
- Aim for 80%+ accuracy
- Use mistakes as learning opportunities
